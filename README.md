# 🔭 Nahom Wondimu  

**`Shaping the future instead of inheriting it.`**

I’m a Computer Science student at the University of Maryland (University Honors) and an aspiring cybersecurity professional. My journey blends experimental systems design, security research, full-stack development — from building AWS “fake internet” labs and penetration testing tools to community platforms and research projects.  

I learn quickly, adapt easily, and build with impact in mind.

## 🔬 Research & Experimental Systems Work

### **Neurobit Maze Simulation**  
*Lightweight agents. Emergent behavior. Self-organizing pathways.*

Built a simulation where small “neurobits” navigate mazes using simple rules, XOR-based mutation, and pattern matching. Focus areas:

- emergent swarm behavior  
- lightweight learning without neural nets  
- mutation-driven adaptation  
- real-time visualization (Pygame)

### **AWS “Fake Internet” Cyber Range**  
*Four subnet domains. Realistic attack paths. Full observability.*

Designed a multi-subnet AWS VPC to simulate real-world network environments (café WiFi, enterprise, malicious infra, university). Used it to run controlled experiments in:

- adversarial scanning + lateral movement  
- network segmentation + routing behavior  
- packet analysis + SIEM log aggregation  
- isolated malware-style behavior

### 🤝 Referrals & Collaborations  
I grow best by working with others. Current collabs include:  
- **Holy Wearhouse Startup** — Worked with a startup to develop a reverse image search capability for an e-commerce store that works by managing a vector database.
- **Tsinat Institute** — Assisted in development and currently maintain organization's web page at [tsinat.org](https://tsinat.org). Hosts 100+ registered users in the local Ethiopian & Eritrean community.   
- **Hackathons** — Worked with a team on Bitcamp 2025 (SafeHub, CyberSafe).
