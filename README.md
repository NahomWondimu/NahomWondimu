# 🔭 Nahom Wondimu  

**`Shaping the future instead of inheriting it.`**

I’m a Computer Science student at the University of Maryland (University Honors) and an aspiring cybersecurity professional. My journey blends experimental systems design, security research, full-stack development — from building AWS “fake internet” labs and penetration testing tools to community platforms and research projects.  

I learn quickly, adapt easily, and build with impact in mind.

## 🔬 Research & Experimental Systems Work  

### **Self-Organizing Neural Agents in Maze Environments (Neurobit Simulation)**  
*Exploring emergent intelligence through lightweight, mutation-driven agents.*

Designed a visual and algorithmic system where “neurobits” — small XOR-mutating agents inspired by neural circuitry and malware propagation — navigate a maze through pattern reinforcement and stochastic adaptation. This project functions as an experimental platform for studying:

- reinforcement-like adaptation in constrained environments  
- emergent swarm behavior from simple rule sets  
- binary pattern matching as an alternative to traditional neural networks  
- mutation-driven optimization through XOR variation  
- interactions between competing agents in limited-resource spaces  

A Pygame-based visualizer renders real-time agent activity, with backend logic structured for future path-learning and optimization experiments.

### **AWS “Fake Internet” Cyber Range — Multi-Subnet Research Environment**  
*A cloud-scale sandbox for adversarial simulation, observability testing, and secure network design.*

Developed a multi-subnet AWS VPC that models four realistic network environments: public café WiFi, enterprise network, malicious infrastructure, and university systems. The platform supports controlled cybersecurity experiments, including:

- cross-subnet attack simulation and lateral movement  
- packet-level inspection across NAT, routing tables, and ACL boundaries  
- SIEM log aggregation and anomaly-detection prototypes  
- adversarial scanning, enumeration, and service probing  
- controlled malware-like behavior inside isolated subnets  

This cyber range provides an experimental foundation for exploring segmentation strategies, detection engineering, and scalable defensive architectures.

### 🤝 Referrals & Collaborations  
I grow best by working with others. Current collabs include:  
- **Holy Wearhouse Startup** — Worked with a startup to develop a reverse image search capability for an e-commerce store that works by managing a vector database.
- **Tsinat Institute** — Assisted in development and currently maintain organization's web page at [tsinat.org](https://tsinat.org). Hosts 100+ registered users in the local Ethiopian & Eritrean community.   
- **Hackathons** — Worked with a team on Bitcamp 2025 (SafeHub, CyberSafe).
